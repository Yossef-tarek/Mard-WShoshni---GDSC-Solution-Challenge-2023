It is the website that has achieved more than 5 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (Quality Education  -Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment -Industry, Innovation, &amp; Infrastructure -Reduced Inequalities -Partnerships)
#The project is fully under development, the entire code is activated, but only some defects will occur in the images when displaying, because we are constantly amending them

This basic destination and the basic code on which the project was built is possible when looking at the website itself (https://gdsc-aou.km-dimensions.com/) Some developments will certainly take place in it

It only requires downloading the brackets program to display the project or any other similar program
